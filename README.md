# STAI-Torrent
##-By Cookie🍪2411

If you are brand new to STAI farming or have a corrupted database, this torrent will help you get back to farming faster. The script used to do the backup will be available on Github to look at. This will be a monthly snapshot of the database (Will do more if I get some donations from the community). I personally help out in several Chia discords as well has STAI and HDD coin discords and have been Chia farming for about 3 years now.

Prerequisites :

   1. Download torrent software. I prefer https://www.qbittorrent.org/download

   2. Torrent link is below. Open the program, copy the URL and add it manually to the program
          magnet:?xt=urn:btih:40ca29bcc96e999bb1ed97d41cddc170134016f1&dn=StaiDB

   3. Wait for the torrent to finish downloading

  4. Get a program that extracts .rar files such as WINRAR or 7Zip

7Zip https://www.7-zip.org/download.html

WINRAR https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0

   5. Navigate to where your STAI database is housed and extract the sqlite file into it


  (Defaults locations)
	-Mac ~/(Replace with your User)/stai/mainnet/db
	-Linux ~ /home/(Replace with your User)/.stai/mainnet/db
	-Windows C:\Users\(Replace with your User)\.stai\mainnet\db

  6. Wait for it to copy then, open STAI and let it verify the DB and get to farming! (Can take a little time to open STAI fully).
