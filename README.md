STAI Database Torrent
By Cookie🍪2411

If you are brand new to STAI farming or have a corrupted or very old database, this torrent will help you save a lot of time syncing. The script used to take snapshots will be available on GitHub to look at. This will be a monthly snapshot of the database (will do more if I get some donations from the community). I personally help out in several Chia discord servers, as well as the STAI and HDDcoin discord servers, and have been Chia farming for about 3 years now.

Prerequisites:
* Archive manager that can read 7-Zip archives, such as 7-Zip (duh): https://www.7-zip.org/download.html
  * Alternatively, WinRAR: https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0
* Make sure the STAI node isn't running.

Instructions:
1. Open the 7-Zip archive in your choice of archive manager.
2. Navigate to the STAI database directory and extract the .sqlite database into it, replacing the old one. By default, it is:
   * Windows C:\Users\<your username>\.stai\mainnet\db
   * Mac: ~/<your username>/.stai/mainnet/db
   * Linux ~ /home/<your username>/.stai/mainnet/db
3. Start STAI (full suite or just the node) and let it verify the DB and get to farming!

It can take a few minutes to open as it's validating a database it has never seen before. Either the CPU or drive that the database is on will be busy during validation.
